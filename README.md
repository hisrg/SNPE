# SNPE
Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine (SNPE) SDKThe Snapdragon Neural Processing Engine (SNPE) is a Qualcomm Snapdragon software accelerated runtime for the execution of deep neural networks. With SNPE, users can:  Execute an arbitrarily deep neural network Execute the network on the SnapdragonTM CPU, the AdrenoTM GPU or the HexagonTM DSP. Debug the network execution on x86 Ubuntu Linux Convert Caffe, Caffe2, ONNXTM and TensorFlowTM models to a SNPE Deep Learning Container (DLC) file Quantize DLC files to 8 bit fixed point for running on the Hexagon DSP Debug and analyze the performance of the network with SNPE tools Integrate a network into applications and other code via C++ or Java
